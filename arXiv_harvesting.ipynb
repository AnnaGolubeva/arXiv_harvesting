    "    - Applying Machine Learning to Physics\n",
    "    - Physics-Inspired Ideas Applied to Machine Learning\n",
    "    - Quantum Computation and Quantum Algorithms for Machine Learning\n",
    "- 3) Create formatted entries for the selected publications and add them to file papers.md\n",

    "- `list_all(afp)`: lists all entries with index, title, tags for review\n",
    "- `show_info(afp, index)`: displays more info on the specified entry in afp\n",
    "- `formatted_block(afp, indices)`: formats entries and concats them into one string as required for physicsml\n",
    "- `add_papers_to_file(new_papers, filename = 'papers.md)`: adds new entries to file papers.md *\n",
